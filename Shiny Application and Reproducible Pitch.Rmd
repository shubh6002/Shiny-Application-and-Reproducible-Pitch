## Overview

This presentation and the application was build for the course Developing Data Products as part of the Coursera Data Science Specializaion.

The Shiny app developed for this assignment is available at: https://shubh6002.shinyapps.io/myapp/

The source codes of ui.R and server.R are available on the GitHub repo: 
https://github.com/shubh6002/Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch

## Dataset
For this application, we used the mtcars dataset.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Model

We used lm to fit a multivariable regression; mpg as outcome, am, cyl, hp, and wt as predictors. The coefficients is shown below,

```{r, echo = TRUE}
lm(mpg ~ am + cyl + hp + wt, data = mtcars)
```
